# Malay-words-stemmer
An algorithm I designed during my internship to stem Bahasa Malaysia words based on the language's grammar properties. 
Uses Malay WordNet as dictionary.

Algorithm returns approximately 78% accuracy.

To perform stemming on word 'pemberian' :
> ``` malaystemmer('pemberian') ```
